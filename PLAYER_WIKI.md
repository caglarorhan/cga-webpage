## 🌆 The Lore

### The World of 2087

In the year 2087, the world has been reshaped by the **Great Collapse** of 2045—a catastrophic cyber attack that brought down global infrastructure. From the ashes rose the **Megacorporations**, entities more powerful than governments, controlling everything from energy to information.

**Neo Kyoto** stands as the crown jewel of the new world order—a sprawling vertical city where gleaming corporate towers pierce the smog-filled sky, while the streets below pulse with neon lights and desperate souls.

### The Factions

Four major factions compete for dominance in the shadow wars:

#### 🏢 **HelixCorp**
The dominant medical and biotech megacorporation. They specialize in cybernetic augmentation and biological enhancements. Their operatives are heavily armored, favoring durability over speed.
- **Heroes:** Vanta, Spark
- **Philosophy:** "Strength Through Enhancement"

#### ⚡ **ArcLight Initiative**
A coalition of hacktivists-turned-mercenaries who believe technology should free humanity, not enslave it. They use stolen corporate tech for guerrilla warfare.
- **Heroes:** Katana, Glyph
- **Philosophy:** "Light the Way"

#### 🕶️ **Vanta Syndicate**
A mysterious criminal organization that operates in the shadows. Masters of infiltration, assassination, and information warfare.
- **Heroes:** Spectre
- **Philosophy:** "Unseen, Unheard, Unstoppable"

#### 💀 **Collapse Unit**
Former corporate security forces who went rogue. They believe the only way forward is to tear down the current system entirely.
- **Heroes:** Byte, Zero
- **Philosophy:** "From Ashes, Rebirth"

#### 🏥 **Independents**
Freelancers with no allegiance, selling their skills to the highest bidder.
- **Heroes:** Mira
- **Philosophy:** "Credits Talk"

### The Grid

The **CyberGrid** is a classified combat training simulation used by corporations to test and train their operatives. But rumors speak of something darker—that the Grid isn't just a simulation. The operatives who enter sometimes... change.
